# GymDays

I got a gym membership! Great right?

However ive been facing an issue... I wanted to track how long ive been going to the gym for but quite frankly none of my previous day tracking methods worked. It started off as a tally on a piece of paper, but that got boring and I would keep forgetting to add the tally after each day. Then I decided to, whenever im curious on how long ive been going for, just google "How many days ago was [insert start date here]". This got very old, very fast. Not only did it mean I would actually have to remember the day I started but I would have to go throught the process of opening google and typing out my question while trying to remember the date.

I was not having it.

So me being me I decided to make this little program. It uses Python, HTML and CSS to display the following:

I also didnt want it to look super boring and plain, I wanted to enjoy visiting this page once every blue moon when I do decide to check up on my day count so I added a pure CSS moving background.
